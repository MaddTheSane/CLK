	A deferring async task queue is one that accepts a list of functions to be performed but defers
	any action until told to perform. It performs them by enquing a single asynchronous task that will
	perform the deferred tasks in order.

	It therefore offers similar semantics to an asynchronous task queue, but allows for management of
	synchronisation costs, since neither defer nor perform make any effort to be thread safe.
