ROM files would ordinarily go here; the copyright status of these is uncertain so they have not been included in this repository.

Expected files:

basic10.rom
basic11.rom
colour.rom
pravetz.rom

Also potentially required:

* microdisc.rom, for loading Microdisc software;
* 8dos.rom, for loading Pravetz 8-DOS software;
* jasmin.rom, for loading Jasmin disk interface software; and
* bd500.rom, for loading Byte Drive 500 software.
