# Emulation

ROM files would ordinarily go here; the copyright status of these is uncertain so they have not been included in this repository.

Expected files:

tos100.img; a 196kb image of the UK Atari ST TOS 1.00 ROM.


# Test Cases.

Included here are Atari ST-targeted versions of EmuTOS, being a significant chunk of freely available and redistributable 68000 code that can be used to test the 68000-in-progress.

EmuTOS is distributed under the GPL. See its licence and other information within the doc/ subdirectory.

It was obtained via http://emutos.sourceforge.net/en/
