BIOS files would ordinarily go here; the copyright status of these is uncertain so they have not been included in this repository.

Expected files:

bios.sms — the EU/US Master System BIOS.
japanese-bios.sms — the Japanese Master System BIOS.

If the file sought by the emulator is missing, it will attempt to boot a game without using the BIOS.
