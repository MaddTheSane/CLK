/*!
	Owns an OpenGL texture resource and provides mechanisms to fill it from bottom left to top right
	with runs of data, ensuring each run is neighboured immediately to the left and right by copies of its
	first and last pixels.

	Although this class is not itself inherently thread safe, it is built to permit one serialised stream
	of calls to provide source data, with an interceding (but also serialised) submission to the GPU at any time.


	Intended usage by the data generator:

		(i)		allocate a write area with allocate_write_area, supplying a maximum size.
		(ii)	call reduce_previous_allocation_to to announce the actual size written.

	This will cause you to have added source data to the target texture. You can then either use that data
	or allow it to expire.

		(iii)	call retain_latest to add the most recently written write area to the flush queue.

	The flush queue contains provisional data, that can sit in the CPU's memory space indefinitely. This facility
	is provided because it is expected that a texture will be built alontside some other collection of data;
	that data in the flush queue is expected to become useful in coordination with something else but should
	be retained at least until then.

		(iv)	call flush to move data to the submit queue.

	When you flush, you'll receive a record of the bounds of all newly-flushed areas of source data. That gives
	an opportunity to correlate the data with whatever else it is being tied to. It will continue to sit in
	the CPU's memory space but has now passed beyond any further modification or reporting.


	Intended usage by the GPU owner:

		(i)		call submit to move data to the GPU and free up its CPU-side resources.

	The latest data is now on the GPU, regardless of where the data provider may be in its process; only data
	that has entered the submission queue is uploaded.
