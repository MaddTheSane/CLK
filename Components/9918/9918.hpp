/*!
	Provides emulation of the TMS9918a, TMS9928 and TMS9929. Likely in the future to be the
	vessel for emulation of sufficiently close derivatives, such as the Master System VDP.

	The TMS9918 and descendants are video display generators that own their own RAM, making it
	accessible through an implicitly-timed register interface, and (depending on model) can generate
	PAL and NTSC component and composite video.

	These chips have only one non-on-demand interaction with the outside world: an interrupt line.
	See get_time_until_interrupt and get_interrupt_line for asynchronous operation options.
