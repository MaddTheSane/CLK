		//	(iii) the Mac pulse-width modulates whatever it reads from the disk speed buffer;
		//	(iv) ... subject to software pulse-width modulation of that pulse-width modulation.
		//
		// So, I believe current motor speed is proportional to a low-pass filtering of
		// the speed buffer. Which I've implemented very coarsely via 'large' bucketed-averages,
		// noting also that exact disk motor speed is always a little approximate.
